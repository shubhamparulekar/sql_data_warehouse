SQL Data Warehouse and Analytics Solution

This repository presents a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, demonstrating the end-to-end process of building a robust data warehouse and generating actionable insights. The project adheres to industry best practices in data engineering and analytics, showcasing a structured approach to data management and reporting.
Overview

The project aims to transform raw, disparate data into a structured and analyzable format through a multi-layered data warehousing approach. It covers data ingestion, cleansing, transformation, and presentation, culminating in a ready-to-use dataset for business intelligence and reporting.
Features

    Multi-Layered Data Architecture: Implements Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers for progressive data refinement.

        Bronze Layer: Raw, immutable data directly ingested from source systems.

        Silver Layer: Cleaned, conformed, and integrated data, ready for initial analysis.

        Gold Layer: Business-ready data structured into dimension and fact tables for analytical and reporting use cases.

    Data Transformation Pipelines: Scripts for ETL/ELT processes to move data between layers.

    Data Catalog: Comprehensive documentation of all tables and columns across the data warehouse layers.

    Actionable Insights: Foundation for generating reports and dashboards to support business decisions.

    Scalable Design: Designed with scalability in mind to accommodate growing data volumes.

Data Architecture

The data architecture follows a medallion architecture pattern, consisting of three distinct layers:

    Bronze Layer:

        Purpose: Ingests raw data from various source systems (e.g., CRM, ERP) without any transformations. It serves as a historical archive.

        Characteristics: Immutable, historical record of source data.

        Files: bronze_crm_cust_info.csv, bronze_crm_prd_info.csv, bronze_crm_sales_details.csv, bronze_erp_cust_az12.csv, bronze_erp_loc_a101.csv, bronze_erp_px_cat_g1v2.csv

    Silver Layer:

        Purpose: Cleanses, standardizes, and integrates data from the Bronze layer. It addresses data quality issues and applies basic transformations, providing a "single source of truth."

        Characteristics: Conformed, integrated, and ready for initial analysis.

        Files: silver_crm_cust_info.csv, silver_crm_prd_info.csv, silver_crm_sales_details.csv, silver_erp_cust_az12.csv, silver_erp_loc_a101.csv, silver_erp_px_cat_g1v2.csv

    Gold Layer:

        Purpose: Presents highly refined, aggregated, and business-centric data. It's optimized for analytical queries and reporting, often structured for specific business needs.

        Characteristics: Typically uses a star schema or snowflake schema, consisting of fact and dimension tables.

        Files: gold_dim_customers.csv, gold_dim_products.csv, gold_fact_sales.csv

Getting Started

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x: The primary language used for scripting.

    Pandas library: Essential for data manipulation (pip install pandas).

    (Optional) A SQL database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server): If you plan to load this data into a database, you'll need a running instance.

    (Optional) Relevant database drivers and connectors: Depending on your chosen database, you might need additional Python libraries (e.g., psycopg2 for PostgreSQL).

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/shubhamparulekar/sql_data_warehouse.git
    cd sql_data_warehouse

    Install Python dependencies:

    pip install pandas

    (If a requirements.txt file is added in the future, you can use pip install -r requirements.txt)

Usage

The scripts/ directory contains the core logic for data processing. You can run these scripts sequentially to build the data warehouse layers.

    Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer):

        Ensure your raw CSV files are placed in the datasets/bronze/ directory.

        (If applicable) Run scripts that ingest data into your initial staging area or database.

    Data Cleansing and Transformation (Silver Layer):

        Execute scripts that process data from the Bronze layer, apply cleansing rules, and store the refined results in datasets/silver/.

    Data Modeling and Aggregation (Gold Layer):

        Run scripts that transform Silver layer data into the final dimension and fact tables, storing them in datasets/gold/ or loading them into your target analytical database.

Example command to run a script (replace your_script.py with the actual script name, found in the scripts/ directory):

python scripts/your_script.py
